# OpenGL 4 Game Project

Hi! This is my first big proyect and repository on GitHub.  
I am learning the basics of C++ and graphic computing, so I decided to make this OpenGL 4.3 project.  
I would really appreciate any opinions or advice as I am new to this.

The project doesn´t follow any specific objective, I am only implementing things that occur to me and I'm learning. The idea is to end up with a project that is easily convertible to a graphics engine (adding an UHD) or to a small video game.

## Version 0.1 (Alpha)  
- Improvement of the player´s jump
- 234% performance improvement
Bugs Fixed
- There was a buffer overflow on the vertex shader that cause underperformance and a crash when you looked to the grass of the coordinates (0, 0, 0)
- There was a bug that cause that you to go down of the map when jumping

## Version 0.0 (Alpha)

- Procedural terrain generator
- Grass generation
- Minimal capability to move
