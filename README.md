# OpenGL Game Proyect

Hi! This is my first big proyect and repository on GitHub.
I am learning the basics of C++ and graphic computing, so I decided to make this proyect. 
I would really appreciate any opinions or advice as I am new to this.

The proyect doesnÂ´t follow any specific objective, I am only implementing things that occur to me and I'm learning. The idea is to end up with a project that is easily convertible to a graphics engine (adding a UHD) or to a small video game.


## Version 0.0 (Alpha)

- Procedural terrain generator
- Grass generation
